# Wind Estimate ML Model
This is a Pytorch ML model to estimate wind directions given a sailing gps track. 
The goal is to use the model to get an accurate wind direction estimate at each point,
enabling live display of vmg, and the ability to accurately segment sailing tracks without having to record wind data.
